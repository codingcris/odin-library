# odin-library
This is a web application developed by me as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It acts as a virtual library by allowing users to add information 
about books including the title, author, page count, and whether or not they have completed reading the book. It uses CSS grid to display the books
added by the user. Future versions will have storage options. As of now, storage is simulated by Javascript, but does not persist beyond a use session. This implementation uses the pre ES6 IIFE Module Pattern and the EventEmitter PubSub pattern to make the codebase modular and allow communication between modules. Future implementations will use ES6 modules.
